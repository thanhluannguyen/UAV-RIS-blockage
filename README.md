## Abstract
This letter considers a UAV aiding communication between a ground transmitter and a ground receiver in the presence of co-channel interference. A discrete-time Markov process is adopted to model the complex nature of the Air-to-Ground (A2G) channel, including the occurrence of Line-of-Sight, Non-Line-of-Sight, and blockage events. Moreover, an adaptive phase-shift-enabled Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is deployed to combat A2G blockage events. Novel frameworks based on the shadowed Rician distribution are proposed to derive closed-form expressions for Ground-to-Air/A2G SINR' distributions. Numerical results show that RISs with large numbers of elements, e.g., 256 RIS elements, improve end-to-end Outage Probability (OP) and reduce blockages.
